So… is Trump actually tanking the economy, or is that just a weird coincidence?

Good question. The data points to Trump’s policies setting up the current problems:

Tariffs: Trump's trade war raised costs for American businesses and consumers — that’s inflation pressure right there.

Tax Cuts: His 2017 tax cuts added $2 trillion to the deficit — and mostly helped the rich, not workers.

Interest Rates: The Fed raised rates to fight inflation — which Trump’s deficit spending helped fuel.

So yeah, the timing isn’t random. If Biden’s handling a mess, it’s because Trump handed him the mop.
